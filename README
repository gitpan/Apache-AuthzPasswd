NAME
     Apache::AuthzPasswd - mod_perl /etc/group Group
     Authorization module

SYNOPSIS
         <Directory /foo/bar>
         # This is the standard authentication stuff
         AuthName "Foo Bar Authentication"
         AuthType Basic

         # The following is needed when you will authenticate
         # via /etc/passwd as well as authorize via /etc/group.
         # Apache::AuthenPasswd is a separate module.
         PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenPasswd

         # Standard require stuff, users, groups and
         # "valid-user" all work OK
         require user username1 username2 ...
         require group groupname1 groupname2 ...
         require valid-user

         PerlAuthzHandler Apache::AuthzPasswd

         </Directory>

         These directives can also be used in the <Location> directive or in
         an .htaccess file.


DESCRIPTION
     For starters, this module could just as well be named
     Apache::AuthzGroup, since it has nothing to do with
     /etc/passwd, but rather works with /etc/group.  However, I
     prefer this name in order to maintain the association with
     Apache::AuthenPasswd, since chances are they will be used
     together.

     (SPEEVES NOTE:  This module does not seem to work without 
     some sort of Authentication module used in conjunction with 
     it...  I haven't looked extensively, but my testing always 
     failed with a:

     couldn't check user.  No user file?

     error in the apache logs when I didn't have a module working 
     at the authentication level.)

     This perl module is designed to work with mod_perl and the
     Apache::AuthenPasswd module by Demetrios E. Paneras
     (dep@media.mit.edu).  It is a direct adaptation (i.e. I
     modified the code) of Michael Parker's
     (parker@austx.tandem.com) Apache::AuthenSmb module (which
     also included an authorization routine).

     The module calls getgrnam using each of the require group
     elements as keys, until a match with the (already
     authenticated) user is found.

     For completeness, the module also handles require user and
     require valid-user directives.

     PerlSetVar SetRemoteGroup

     This allows us to modify the REMOTE_GROUP CGI env variable.
     When set to "yes" it sets REMOTE_GROUP to the group of the 
     authorized user.  Defaults to "no".

     Apache::AuthenPasswd vs. Apache::AuthzPasswd

     I've taken "authentication" to be meaningful only in terms
     of a user and password combination, not group membership.
     This means that you can use Apache::AuthenPasswd with the
     require user and require valid-user directives.  In the
     /etc/passwd and /etc/group context I consider require group
     to be an "authorization" concern.  I.e., group authorization
     consists of establishing whether the already authenticated
     user is a member of one of the indicated groups in the
     require group directive.  This process may be handled by
     Apache::AuthzPasswd.  Admittedly, AuthzPasswd is a misnomer,
     but I wanted to keep AuthenPasswd and AuthzPasswd related,
     if only by name.

     I welcome any feedback on this module, esp. code
     improvements, given that it was written hastily, to say the
     least.
